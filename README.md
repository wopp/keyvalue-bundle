KeyValue Bundle 
===============

KeyValue bundle for Symfony2 projects using MongoDB or Redis as storage

It offers integration with MongoDB and Redis storage through an unified interface provided by a KeyValueService.

You can also make key-value entities expired on a defined timestamp (or definining a number of seconds).
